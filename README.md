# Python-Guessing-Game

Here I will make a simple python guessing game.

I will aim to use and understand different search methods.

The task of this program is simple:

    1. Greet the user and prompt them to think of a number without typing it.

    2. Guess the number, by systematically lowering the amount of possibilities by half each time.

    3. Ask the user if the guess their guess is lower or higher than the actual value.

    4. adjust search parameters<return>

    5. repeat steps 2 through 4 until certian amount
